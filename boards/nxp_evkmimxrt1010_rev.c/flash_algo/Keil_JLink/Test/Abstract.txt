This is a simple testprogram which shows how 
 Flash Programming Algorithms can be tested

The project shows how the Flash Programming Algorithms 
for a ST STM32F103RB device using a Keil Evaluation
Board MCBSTM32 can be tested.

It uses the STM32F10x Flash Programming Algoritms
copied from folder .Keil\ARM\Flash\Flash\STM32F10x.

The Flash Programming Algoritms are configured for 
"STM32F10x Med-density Flash".

The program runs in onChip RAM and calls the lowlevel
Flash programming functions.
